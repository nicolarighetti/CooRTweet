Coordinated behavior is a relevant social media strategy employed for political astroturfing (Keller et al., 2020), the spread of inappropriate content online (Giglietto et al., 2020), and activism. Software for academic research and investigative journalism has been developed in the last few years to detect coordinated behavior, such as the [CooRnet R package](https://github.com/fabiogiglietto/CooRnet) (Giglietto, Righetti, Rossi, 2020), which detects Coordinated Link Sharing Behavior (CLSB) and Coordinated Image Sharing on Facebook and Instagram ([CooRnet website](http://coornet.org)), and the [Coordination Network Toolkit](https://github.com/QUT-Digital-Observatory/coordination-network-toolkit/blob/main/README.md) by Timothy Graham (Graham, QUT Digital Observatory, 2020).

The **CooRTweet** package builds on the existing literature on coordinated behavior and the experience of previous software, particularly CooRnet, to provide R users with an easy-to-use tool to detect various coordinated networks on Twitter. 


# Install

## Install from CRAN

```r
install.packages("CooRTweet")
```

# Quick Start

The package works with data retrieved from the Twitter Academic API in the JSON format provided by the function *get_all_tweets* of the R package [academictwitteR](https://github.com/cjbarrie/academictwitteR), which retrieves tweets and users' information at once.

For a walk-through see the [vignette](https://github.com/nicolarighetti/CooRTweet/blob/master/vignettes/vignette.md).
