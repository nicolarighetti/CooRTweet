# CooRTweet@Polars
*[Nicola Righetti](https://github.com/nicolarighetti), [Paul Balluff](https://github.com/mrwunderbar666)*

**High Performance Branch based on [R-Polars](https://pola-rs.github.io/r-polars/index.html)**

# Notes on Polars Usage

[Polars](https://pola.rs/) is a dataframe library which can handle larger-than-memory data. This is an experimental branch and should be used with care. There are certain advantages and considerations when using this edition of CooRTweet:

- Only makes sense to use if your dataset has more than 5 million rows
- Polars can stream the data and execute computations in parallel, this makes it very efficient in terms of memory usage and also completely utilizes all your CPU cores
- It probably gives a 10x-50x speedup compared to `data.table`, depending on your use case
- **But** `r-polars` is **not** hosted on CRAN, and under certain circumstances harder to install
- `r-polars` is still under active development and is not as feature rich as the Python version of Polars
- Currently, only the `detect_groups` function is implemented with `r-polars`, other functions will follow
- There is only limited support available from the CooRTweet developers when using this branch

## Installing Polars

Quoted from the `r-polars` documentation:

The recommended way to install `r-polars` is via R-multiverse:

``` r
Sys.setenv(NOT_CRAN = "true")
install.packages("polars", repos = "https://community.r-multiverse.org")
```

[The “Install”
vignette](https://pola-rs.github.io/r-polars/vignettes/install.html)
(`vignette("install", "polars")`) gives more details on how to install
this package and other ways to install it.

# Introduction

Coordinated behavior is a relevant social media strategy employed for political astroturfing (Keller et al., 2020), the spread of inappropriate content online (Giglietto et al., 2020), and activism. Software for academic research and investigative journalism has been developed in the last few years to detect coordinated behavior, such as the [CooRnet R package](https://github.com/fabiogiglietto/CooRnet) (Giglietto, Righetti, Rossi, 2020), which detects Coordinated Link Sharing Behavior (CLSB) and Coordinated Image Sharing on Facebook and Instagram ([CooRnet website](http://coornet.org)), and the [Coordination Network Toolkit](https://github.com/QUT-Digital-Observatory/coordination-network-toolkit/blob/main/README.md) by Timothy Graham (Graham, QUT Digital Observatory, 2020).

The **CooRTweet** package builds on the existing literature on coordinated behavior and the experience of previous software, particularly CooRnet, to provide R users with an easy-to-use tool to detect various coordinated networks on Twitter and any other social media. It further opens up the possibility of cross-platform analysis. 


# Install

## Install from Github

```r
Sys.setenv(NOT_CRAN = "true")
install.packages("polars", repos = "https://community.r-multiverse.org")

install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("nicolarighetti/CooRTweet@polars")
```

# Quick Start

The package is compatible with any data, provided that it is formatted appropriately. It offers comprehensive support for data obtained from the Twitter Academic API in the JSON format. This format is generated by the function `get_all_tweets` from the R package [academictwitteR](https://github.com/cjbarrie/academictwitteR), which simultaneously retrieves tweets and user information. Additionally, the simple function `prep_data` aids in formatting the data as required by the package.

For a walk-through see the [vignette](https://github.com/nicolarighetti/CooRTweet/blob/master/vignettes/vignette.md).
