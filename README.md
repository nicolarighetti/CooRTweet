Coordinated behavior is a relevant social media strategy employed for political astroturfing (Keller et al., 2020), the spread of inappropriate content online (Giglietto et al., 2020), and activism. Software for academic research and investigative journalism has been developed in the last few years to detect coordinated behavior, such as the [CooRnet R package](https://github.com/fabiogiglietto/CooRnet) (Giglietto, Righetti, Rossi, 2020), which detects Coordinated Link Sharing Behavior (CLSB) and Coordinated Image Sharing on Facebook and Instagram ([CooRnet website](http://coornet.org)), and the [Coordination Network Toolkit](https://github.com/QUT-Digital-Observatory/coordination-network-toolkit/blob/main/README.md) by Timothy Graham (Graham, QUT Digital Observatory, 2020).

The **CooRTweet** package builds on the existing literature on coordinated behavior and the experience of previous software, particularly CooRnet, to provide R users with an easy-to-use tool to detect various coordinated networks on Twitter and any other social media. It further opens up the possibility of cross-platform analysis. 


# Install

## Install from CRAN

```r
install.packages("CooRTweet")
```

# Quick Start

The package is compatible with any data, provided that it is formatted appropriately. It offers comprehensive support for data obtained from the Twitter Academic API in the JSON format. This format is generated by the function `get_all_tweets` from the R package [academictwitteR](https://github.com/cjbarrie/academictwitteR), which simultaneously retrieves tweets and user information. Additionally, the simple function `prep_data` aids in formatting the data as required by the package.
