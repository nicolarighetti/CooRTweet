#' detect_groups
#'
#' @description
#' Function to perform the initial stage in detecting coordinated behavior.
#' It identifies pairs of accounts that share the same objects in a time_window.
#' See details.
#'
#' @details This function achieves the initial stage in detecting coordinated
#' behavior by identifying accounts who share identical objects within the same
#' temporal window, and is preliminary to the network analysis conducted using
#' the \link{generate_coordinated_network} function.
#' `detect_groups` groups the data by `object_id` (uniquely identifies
#' content) and calculates the time differences between all
#' `content_id` (ids of account generated contents) within their groups.
#' It then filters out all `content_id` that are higher than the `time_window`
#' (in seconds). It returns a `data.table` with all IDs of coordinated
#' contents. The `object_id` can be for example: hashtags, IDs of tweets being
#' retweeted, or URLs being shared. For twitter data, best use \link{reshape_tweets}.
#'
#' @param x a data.table with the columns: `object_id` (uniquely identifies
#' coordinated content), `account_id` (unique ids for accounts), `content_id`
#' (id of account generated content), `timestamp_share` (integer). See also
#' \link{reshape_tweets} and \link{prep_data}.
#'
#' @param time_window the number of seconds within which shared contents
#' are to be considered as coordinated (default to 10 seconds).
#'
#' @param time_window_low the lower boundary of the time window within which
#' shared contents are to be considered as coordinated (default to 0 seconds).
#'
#' @param min_participation The minimum number of actions required for a account
#' to be included in subsequent analysis (default set at 2). This ensures that
#' only accounts with a minimum level of activity in the original dataset are
#' included in subsequent analysis. It is important to distinguish this from the
#' frequency of repeated interactions an account has with another specific account,
#' as represented by edge weight. The edge weight parameter is utilized in the
#' `generate_coordinated_network` function as a concluding step in identifying
#' coordinated behavior.
#'
#' @param remove_loops Should loops (shares of the same objects made by the same
#' account within the time window) be removed? (default to TRUE).
#'
#' @param intent Specifies the network projection to generate. By default, it is
#' set to "account", which produces a network where nodes represent accounts that
#' share common objects within the specified time window. Alternatively, setting
#' intent to "objects", the resulting network consists of objects. In the "objects"
#' projection, an edge is formed between two objects if they are shared by the same
#' account(s) within the given time window. Note that for this projection, using
#' a wider time window might be more appropriate, as the precise coordination in
#' time becomes less relevant compared to the account-level coordinated behavior.
#' However, using a narrow time window may still be useful if the goal is to detect
#' cases where objects are shared in rapid succession by the same account(s).
#'
#' @param ... keyword arguments for backwards compatibility.
#'
#' @return a data.table with ids of coordinated contents. Columns:
#' `object_id`, `account_id`, `account_id_y`, `content_id`, `content_id_y`,
#' `timedelta`. The `account_id` and `content_id` represent the "older"
#' data points, `account_id_y` and `content_id_y` represent the "newer"
#' data points. For example, account A retweets from account B, then account A's
#' content is newer (i.e., `account_id_y`).
